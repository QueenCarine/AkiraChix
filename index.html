    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <P>Experiencing things for the first time is always overwhelming, but as the tradonic treadmill effect suggests, you get used to them as you keep doing them.
        Things have been hard for me as well but I've adapted quickly.So far, so good. </P>

            <ol>
                <li><h4>Learning about different cultures.</h4></li>
                <p>Arriving at AkiraChix, I've had the privilege to meet fellow students from diverse backgrounds and we've dived through all their cultures.</p>
                <h5 style="font-size: medium;"><u>Kenya</u></h5>
                <p> 
                    In Kenya, more than 60 languages are spoken and there are more than 40 ethnic groups. Almost everyone there speaks more than one African language.</p>
                    <h5 style="font-size: medium;"><u>Ethiopia</u></h5>
                    <h6 style="font-size: medium;"><u><b>Year 2017</b></u></h6>
                    <p>Ethiopia follows the Ethiopian calendar, which is different from the Gregorian calendar used in most of the world. 
                        The Ethiopian year starts on September 11th (or September 12th in a Gregorian leap year)</p>

                <li><h4>Meeting new people from different countries.</h4>
                <p>I've been able to make friends from several different backgrounds.</p></li>
                <li><h4>Getting an overview of how my time at AkiraChix will look like.</h4>
                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I've been told what I can expect from the program and done an assignment that helped me know what I will be learning during the program.</p></li>
